                                                  #Video game sales
                                                 
In this project I'm going to analyse a dataset where there are 16598 rows and 11 columns at the beginning. That db is about games with more than
100.000 sales around the world in video games's history. The focus is to find some patterns, considering genre, release date, plataform and others attributes

Here we have a dataset with unknown rows, that makes necessary a cleaning in order to get only the rows with every single variable. This will make the project more
reliable and we'll get more insights from there.

##Objectives:

* Show the genres with more sales in history;
* Compare the years with more sales;
* Analyse number of sales per region;
* Try to find patterns involving year x genre x region;


## Analyse to be done

For this analyse will be used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), that will make the process easier to understand and more organized.

Also We'll use some of Python Libraries, such as:

* [Pandas;](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [NumPY;](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib.](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

Maybe It'll be necessary to use other, and if it happens, I'll insert here during the project. It's a simple project, only to get myself into this
fantastic world of Data Analyses.

In my opnion to work with projects is the main way to learn something, so let's get started!
